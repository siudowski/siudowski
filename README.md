<!---### Hi there, I'm siudowski ðŸ‘‹

### I'm just a hobbyist, focused almost exclusively on Unity and C#.

### I've been playing around with Unity since early 2017 and for past years my experience was limited to small demo games, learning projects and prototypes of limited difficulty.
### On top of that, I am also capable of 3d modelling in blender, a skill I often need in my small scope projects.
### For some time I've been a part of Cities:Skylines content creator community, where I polished my skills as a 3d artist.
